# Full-Backup script 

### Bash script to take the full-backup of a cPanel server with custom paths

##### I have created this script to take the full-backup of a cPanel server to a backup-server during a server cancellation/migration.

###### Download https://github.com/PavanPrasad/serverfullbackup/archive/refs/heads/main.zip in your server's desired path
###### Extract the zip file
###### Edit the server fields as per your requirement
###### Execute the fullbackup.sh script in your cPanel server
``
sh fullbackup.sh
``
###### Provide the backup server's password.

##### Thats it.....now sit back and relax!!! You could see your backups is successfully saved on the remote destination server.
